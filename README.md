### Python2 implementation of NORX.

[NORX](https://norx.io) is a new authenticated encryption scheme with support for associated data (AEAD) and a first round candidate in [CAESAR](http://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar.html). The specification of NORX can be found [here](https://norx.io/data/norx.pdf).

####License
The NORX source code is released under the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). The full license text is included in the file `LICENSE`.

####Usage & Examples
See [main.py](https://github.com/Daeinar/norx-py/blob/master/main.py).

####Warning
##### The authors are confident that it is secure, but nevertheless NORX still lacks extensive analysis. So don't use it in your applications, yet.
